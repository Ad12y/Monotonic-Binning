# A Python Class for Monotonic Binning in Credit Risk Modeling

The BinningProcessor class is a Python tool designed to facilitate monotonic binning of continuous variables, primarily used in credit risk modeling and scoring. This class implements common techniques such as Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation and Information Value (IV) calculation to discretize numeric features into categorical or ordinal bins while maintaining monotonic relationships with the target variable.

Key Features:

Monotonic Binning: Enables segmentation of the population into risk groups based on continuous variables like income, age, or credit utilization ratio.
Model Interpretability: Transforms continuous variables into categorical or ordinal features, enhancing model interpretability for stakeholders.
WoE Transformation: Ensures monotonic relationships between predictor variables and the likelihood of default, crucial for credit risk modeling.
IV Calculation: Helps in variable selection by identifying the most informative predictors based on their predictive power for credit risk.
Scoringcard Development: Facilitates the development of scoringcards for credit risk assessment, assigning scores to individuals based on their risk profile.
Usage:
The BinningProcessor class can be instantiated with a DataFrame containing the data to be processed. It provides a binning method that takes parameters such as the column to be binned, the label column, and thresholds for p-values and minimum bin size. The method returns a WoE grouped table and IV value, aiding in credit risk analysis and decision-making.

This tool is essential for credit risk professionals, data scientists, and analysts involved in credit scoring, risk segmentation, and model development for financial institutions and lending organizations.
