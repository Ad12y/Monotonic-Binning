# A Python Class for Monotonic Binning in Credit Risk Modeling

The BinningProcessor class in Python facilitates monotonic binning of continuous variables, crucial in credit risk modeling. It implements Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation and Information Value (IV) calculation to discretize numeric features into categorical or ordinal bins while preserving monotonic relationships with the target variable.

Key Features:

Monotonic Binning: Segmentation of population into risk groups based on continuous variables like income, age, or credit utilization ratio.
Model Interpretability: Transforms continuous variables into categorical or ordinal features, enhancing interpretability for stakeholders.
WoE Transformation: Ensures monotonic relationships between predictor variables and likelihood of default, crucial in credit risk modeling.
IV Calculation: Facilitates variable selection by identifying the most informative predictors for credit risk.
Scoringcard Development: Helps in developing scoringcards for credit risk assessment, assigning scores based on risk profile.
Usage:
The BinningProcessor class can be instantiated with a DataFrame. Its binning method takes parameters such as the column to be binned, label column, and thresholds for p-values and minimum bin size. It returns a WoE grouped table and IV value, aiding in credit risk analysis and decision-making.

This tool is indispensable for credit risk professionals, data scientists, and analysts involved in credit scoring, risk segmentation, and model development for financial institutions and lending organizations.

(Note: Example usage can be found in the Jupyter notebook.)
